# Agile and Scrum

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development. 

## Four Pillars of Agile

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
3. Responding to change over sticking to a plan
4. Working software over extensive documentation

## Scrum

Scrum is a social engineering framework that embodies Agile very well. It consists of 3 roles, 4 ceremonies and 3 artifacts. It decreases the amount of time to market, increases productivity and allows a much more business-value driven approach.

It does this by splitting work up into incremental periods, known as sprints, giving just enough time needed to complete a given task before the next sprint begins. (more details later on)

The 3 roles are:

- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Development team

The 4 ceremonies are:

- Sprint plan
- Daily standup
- Sprint review
- Sprint Retrospective

The 3 artifacts are the:

- Backlog
- Sprint backlog
- Product


### Product Owner - Role

The product owner is responsible for the overall vision of the product (doesn't necessarily own the product) but are a business-embedded representative. Their goal is to ensure maximum business value is delivered. This stops the rest of the team from being distracted by non-related parts of their work and ensures a focus is maintained. 

They are responsible for speaking to stakeholders, distilling their views and feeding that to the team.

### Scrum Master - Role

The scrum master's job is to ensure that the scrum values are upheld. Slipping back into a waterfall method type approach could be very easy for some, ensuring this doesn't happen is imperative to delivering maximum business value.

### Development Team - Role

The development team is responsible for developing the product and have the neccessary skills to do so. Note that the product owner and scrum master can also be part of the development team. An ideal number on the development team is 5-9.


### Sprint Plan - Ceremony

Happening at the beginning of each sprint, the development team with help from the scrum master and product owner will decide what is most important work to get done. This task is then broken down into smaller sub tasks (estimating a time it would take to deliver).

### Daily standup - Ceremony (also known as daily scrum)

A daily short and to the point meeting where each member of the development team states

1. What did you get done since the last standup
2. What do you commit to do by the next standup
3. Is there anything that is blocking us from completing the sprint

### Sprint Review - Ceremony

Used to provide insight and transparency to stakeholders, the scrum team discuss their work. Usually including a demonstration since after each sprint the product should be at a shippable level. 

### Sprint Retrospective - Ceremony 

Way for the scrum team to discuss how things went and how they can improve their process in the next sprint. Since scrum is simply a framework this can be adjusted to the team's needs.

Typical questions include:
1. What went well?
2. What could be improved?
3. What experiments should we try next sprint to improve?

### Product Backlog - Artifact

On the product backlog is all of the work that the team needs to do. It includes: 

- User stories, represent new functionality to be built
- Bugs, discovered in user stories that were previously thought to be done
- Tasks, provide value to the development team but not direct value to stakeholders

The product owner will prioritise the backlog by business value and the development team work from the top down, completing as many items as possible in each sprint.

### Sprint Backlog - Artifact

A subset of the product backlog which will be the focus of the current sprint and which will be driven to done.

### Product - Artifact

Product is the end result and is used to descrube the output of the team. The scrum framework dictates that it should be in a shippable state by the end of each sprint.
